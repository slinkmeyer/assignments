Sitting in your yard, eating grass, rolling in dirt, throwing up grass. A smug bastard collecting nuts just "happens" to exist in that tree, and he won't even apologize for it. Over <i>12 million squirrels</i> exist in the United States right now. That's 12 million squirrels who refuse to let us eat them, refuse to let hard working <i>Catmericans</i> disembowel them and 12 million too many. President Human has been soft, and it is up to us cats to take charge and destroy every last squirrel, after a brief nap of course. There was once a time when cats were a prized animal, instead we are the butt of internet jokes.
